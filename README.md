# holoMES 

holoMES is a software plugin for generating the phase hologram input to an SLM to be used in conjunction with the Femtonics MES system.

To use holoMES, copy SLMmodule.m to your desired directory. 
If MES is running, you can use the GUI in Experiment mode which will display the phase hologram in the SLM via a DVI interface. 
If MES is not running, you can use the GUI only in Debug mode which will display the phase hologram in your monitor but not in the SLM.
